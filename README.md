### The Red Carpet
In today's time, where we hardly have "family time", Craftin Images has launched an IP, "The Red Carpet" for the crème de la crème of the society , so they can spend a day with their family and friends.We propose the third edition with the theme by inviting guests (crème de la crème ) from the fraternity of Bureaucrat , Socialite, Professionals ..etc., for an evening of Entertainment & Engagement. We propose to invite approx. 20 pax for the event.

### The Other Side
India’s first IP, showcasing the other side of famous personalities.
People generally tend to form an opinion about famous personalities based on their area of competency, like reel image for an actor, diplomacy for a politician and sober & emotionless for medical professionals and so on.
Our endeavour is to expand the horizon of this “perceived” image and allow everyone to understand the humane, lighter, humorous or talented side – “The Other Side” – of these professionals / personalities.
We propose to invite a senior management professional from corporate , who would be interviewed alongside a celebrity.
